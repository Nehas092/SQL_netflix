# Netflix Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the use of **PostgreSQL** for solving real-world business problems by analyzing Netflix's content database. The dataset contains detailed information about movies and TV shows, including their titles, genres, release years, ratings, countries of origin, directors, cast, and descriptions. 

Through a series of SQL queries, I have addressed **13 business problems**, showcasing data extraction, transformation, and analysis techniques.



## Key Features
